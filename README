Data accompanying the manuscript Koedooder & Stock et al. Diatom-bacteria interactions modulate the composition and productivity of benthic diatom biofilms.


-	countdata.xlsx 	contains the averaged diatom cell counts per well per day
-	growth_rates.txt contains the maximum growth rates for the different diatom species. These growth rates were calculated on the log2 tranformed cell counts from T1 to T4 using a moving windows approach of 3 days
-	div partitioning script.R provides the used procedure to calculate the algal diversity-productivity relationship as in Loreau & Hector
-	16S_OTU_table.txt contains the read counts per sample as well as the taxonomic assignment to the operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Reads assigned to chloroplasts and mitochondria have been removed

Abbreviations include:
Cyl: Cylindrotheca closterium
Nav: Navicula phyllepta
Sem. Seminavis robusta
Triple: all three diatom species together
